# Welcome to CELLO
<font color='grey'>Cloud and EarthCARE caL/vaL Observations</font>

```{admonition} Overall objectives of the CELLO campaigns
:class: tip
1. Provide in-situ calibration and validation (cal/val) data for the EarthCARE mission scientists and product development team in a range of cloudy environments and temperature regimes.
2. Collocate the EarthCARE correlative observations with overflights of ground-based remote sensing sites whenever possible.
```
The collocations with the ground-based remote sensing sites will ultimately provide a much more comprehensive cal/val dataset than ascertainable by any single measurement platform. 

**Meet our campaigns:**
