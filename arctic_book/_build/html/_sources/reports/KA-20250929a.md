```{admonition} EarthCARE target scenarios
:class: tip
<b>Melting layer:</b> Porpoising through melting layer over ocean.<br>
<b>Rain:</b> Precipitating clouds over ocean.<br>
<b>Marine Sc:</b> Vertical profiles including drizzle.<br>
<b>Complex multi-layer scenes:</b> Multiple low cloud decks.

```{admonition} Flight summary
:class: note
<p style='text-align: justify;'>During the research flight on 29th September 2025, we targeted <b>mixed-phase clouds</b>, and specifically the <b>melting layer</b> between <b>1.2 and 3.5 km altitude</b> underneath <b>EarthCARE (orbit #7603C)</b>. We performed porpoising through the melting layer, covering temperatures between <b>-6°C and +5°C</b> and sampling liquid droplets, ice crystals, drizzle, rain and snow. </p>
