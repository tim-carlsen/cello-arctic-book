```{admonition} EarthCARE target scenarios
:class: tip
<b>Melting layer:</b> Porpoising through melting layer over ocean.<br>
<b>Rain:</b> Precipitating clouds over ocean.<br>
<b>Marine Sc:</b> Vertical profiles including drizzle.<br>
<b>Complex multi-layer scenes:</b> Multiple low cloud decks.
```


```{admonition} Flight summary
:class: note
<p style='text-align: justify;'>During the research flight on 3rd October 2025, we targeted <b>mixed-phase clouds</b>, and specifically the <b>melting layer</b> between <b>0.9 and 4.0 km altitude</b> underneath <b>EarthCARE (orbit #7665C)</b>. We performed porpoising through the melting layer, covering temperatures between <b>-5°C and +6°C</b> and sampling liquid droplets, ice crystals, drizzle, rain and snow. It was a very complex multi-layer scene, so it was hard to say when we were in cloud and when it was just high humidity soup around us. Thus, we also performed some cloud layer hunting, flying some short straight legs when we caught a cloud layer. </p>
