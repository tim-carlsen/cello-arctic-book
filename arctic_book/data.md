For publications using CELLO data, please include this acknowledgement, to ensure the recognition of contributions to the data collection, while promoting its open and respectful use:

> "CELLO was supported by the ESA Earth Observation Envelope Programme (ESA-EOEP) RFQ/3-18397/24/NL/SC, EU-HORIZON-WIDERA-2021 Grant 101079385 (BRACE-MY) and the European Research Council (ERC) through Consolidator Grant 101045273 (STEP-CHANGE)."  [The specific data used in this study was made available by instution/person XY thanks with partial support from agency XYZ]


## Data access

At the conclusion of each campaign, the preliminary and consolidated airborne data will be uploaded to the ESA Atmospheric Validation Data Centre (EVDC) as
quickly as possible. All airborne data products will be made available in the Network Common
Data Format (netCDF), in compliance with the EarthCARE Data Protocol and with standardised
metadata following the Generic Earth Observations Metadata Standard (GEOMS).

## Data Policy

CELLO encourages free use and access to its data and relies on the integrity of the scientific community to ensure that this open data policy does not diminish the contributions of those who collected these data.

CELLO data are a product of the collective efforts of various independent research groups, whose efforts have often benefited from financial support by external funding agencies. The data represents years of work in developing, certifying, and operating instruments, often tied to specific research or Ph.D. projects. We ask users to respect the priority of the data collectors by coordinating their use of CELLO data with the Principal Investigators (PIs) responsible for the data collection, and by clearly acknowledging the source of the data used in all publications and presentations.
