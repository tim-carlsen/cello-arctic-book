```{admonition} Flight summary
:class: note
<p style='text-align: justify;'>During the research flight on 28th September 2025, we targeted <b>cirrus clouds</b> between <b>7.0 and 8.0 km altitude</b> underneath <b>EarthCARE (orbit #7587C)</b>. We combined the northbound EC leg with a southbound leg further East, potentially catching the cirrus clouds downwind of the EC orbit (strong westerly winds at that altitude during EC overpass). </p>

Flight track for KA-20250928a.
```
Flight path (dashed line) superimposed on the MSI-RGR-1C product on 28th September 2025. The ATLID ground track is shown in yellow, while the EC leg (for correlative observations) is shown as a continuous line.


## Conditions

Complicated cirrus scene during EC overpass with several layers. The majority of the cirrus was sampled before EC meet at altitudes between 7.0 and 7.9 km, only limited cirrus after EC meet. During the southbound (post-EC) leg we sampled cirrus and very thin layers of mixed-phase cloud with liquid droplets sampled down to -24°C.
