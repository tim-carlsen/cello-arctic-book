```{admonition} Flight summary
:class: note
<p style='text-align: justify;'>During the research flight on 28th September 2025, we targeted <b>cirrus clouds</b> between <b>7.0 and 8.0 km altitude</b> underneath <b>EarthCARE (orbit #7587C)</b>. We combined the northbound EC leg with a southbound leg further East, potentially catching the cirrus clouds downwind of the EC orbit (strong westerly winds at that altitude during EC overpass). </p>
