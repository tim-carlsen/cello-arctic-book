```{admonition} EarthCARE target scenarios
:class: tip
<b>Melting layer:</b> Porpoising through melting layer over ocean.<br>
<b>Rain:</b> Precipitating clouds over ocean.<br>

```{admonition} Flight summary
:class: note
<p style='text-align: justify;'>During the research flight on 29th September 2025, we targeted <b>mixed-phase clouds</b>, and specifically the <b>melting layer</b> between <b>1.2 and 3.5 km altitude</b> underneath <b>EarthCARE (orbit #7603C)</b>. We performed porpoising through the melting layer, covering temperatures between <b>-6°C and +5°C</b> and sampling liquid droplets, ice crystals, drizzle, rain and snow. </p>

Flight track for KA-20250929a.
```
Flight path (dashed line) superimposed on the MSI-RGR-1C product on 29th September 2025. The ATLID ground track is shown in yellow, while the EC leg (for correlative observations) is shown as a continuous line.


## Conditions

During the EC leg, we experienced low mixed-phase clouds (with some overlying high clouds). Mostly continuous cloud decks, but sometimes a bit broken up in the vertical. We sampled between 1.2 and 3.5 km altitude, covering temperatures between -6°C and +5°C. This way, we measured rain and snow above and below the melting layer in addition to sampling cloud droplets and ice crystals.

## Events

Time (UTC) | Comment
-------------| -----
12:53 | Takeoff Kiruna
14:04 | Start ec_leg
14:20 | EarthCARE overpass (orbit #7603C)
14:37 | End ec_leg
15:53 | Landing Kiruna


## Execution

- Takeoff KRN: 12:53 UTC (14:53 LT)
- Hawkeye running
- 13:20 UTC: delayed due to strong headwinds, expected arrival @WP1 at 14:00 UTC, request for arrival @FL100 so try to go down already
- 13:30 UTC: will start descent to FL100 after we passed the mountains
- 13:44 UTC: start descending towards WP, 800ft/min
- 13:59 UTC: vicinity of WP1, FL150
- 14:04 UTC, WP1, start ec_leg
- 14:07 UTC: WPA
- 14:10 UTC: WPB
- 14:13 UTC: start ascent after porpoising down
- 14:15 UTC: WPC
- ground speed 237 kt, Temperatures from cockpit were ~2°C higher than SAT
- 14:19 UTC: going a bit higher to cover temperatures down to -5°C
- 14:19 UTC: start descent again, 1000 ft/min, EC overpass
- 14:24 UTC: WPE
- 14:27 UTC: alt capture, start ascent again
- 14:30 UTC: WP2, continue same heading to extend ec_leg
- 14:32 UTC: continue climb until FL150
- 14:37 UTC: finish ec_leg, going home
- Landing KRN: 15:53 UTC (17:53 LT)

- 14:18 UTC: TAS179, -2°C, FL090
- 14:19 UTC: TAS187, -4°C, FL100, going a bit up to -5°C
- 14:19 UTC: TAS188, -5°C, FL107, small and big ice on 2DS, EC overpass
- 14:21 UTC: TAS198, -3°C, FL097
- 14:23 UTC: TAS193, 0°C, FL079
- 14:24 UTC: TAS192, 2°C, FL065, in cloud all the time
- 14:25 UTC: can see ocean below, little rain, much less than before
- 14:27 UTC: TAS190, 5°C, FL040, below cloud, can still see ocean, looks like little rain still on windshield
- 14:29 UTC: cloud base roughly, TAS175, 3°C, FL063, completely in cloud again

- 14:34 UTC: 2DS not updating, but receiving bytes, no image update (took video), just doesn't seem to see a particle right now
- 14:34 UTC: TAS189, -4°C, FL110, FCDP updating, very small droplets (maybe that's why nothing 2DS)
- 14:36 UTC: TAS196, -8°C, FL131
- 14:37 UTC: TAS198, -10°C, FL150
- 14:37 UTC: out of cloud top, going home, 2DS updating again and seeing particles

- in-flight entertainment + service starts
- 14:57 UTC: no cloud anymore, we are above it it seems
- 15:36 UTC: in cloud during approach
