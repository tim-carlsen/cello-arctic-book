```{admonition} EarthCARE target scenarios
:class: tip
<b>Melting layer:</b> Porpoising through melting layer over ocean.<br>
<b>Rain:</b> Precipitating clouds over ocean.<br>
<b>Marine Sc:</b> Vertical profiles including drizzle.<br>
<b>Complex multi-layer scenes:</b> Multiple low cloud decks.
```


```{admonition} Flight summary
:class: note
<p style='text-align: justify;'>During the research flight on 1st October 2025, we targeted <b>mixed-phase clouds</b>, and specifically the <b>melting layer</b> between <b>0.9 and 3.6 km altitude</b> underneath <b>EarthCARE (orbit #7634C)</b>. We performed porpoising through the melting layer, covering temperatures between <b>-6°C and +9°C</b> and sampling liquid droplets, ice crystals, drizzle, rain and snow. After the EC leg, we climbed and sampled <b>cirrus clouds North of Andenes</b>, where the <b>ground-based lidar at ALOMAR</b> was sampling cirrus clouds throughout the EC overpass and the collocated airborne sampling. </p>
