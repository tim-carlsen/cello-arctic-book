```{admonition} Flight summary
:class: note
<p style='text-align: justify;'>During the research flight on 1st October 2025, we targeted <b>mixed-phase clouds</b>, and specifically the <b>melting layer</b> between <b>0.9 and 3.6 km altitude</b> underneath <b>EarthCARE (orbit #7634C)</b>. We performed porpoising through the melting layer, covering temperatures between <b>-6°C and +9°C</b> and sampling liquid droplets, ice crystals, drizzle, rain and snow. After the EC leg, we climbed and sampled <b>cirrus clouds North of Andenes</b>, where the <b>ground-based lidar at ALOMAR</b> was sampling cirrus clouds throughout the EC overpass and the collocated airborne sampling. </p>

Flight path (dashed line) superimposed on the MSI-RGR-1C product on 1st October 2025. The ATLID ground track is shown in yellow, while the EC leg (for correlative observations) is shown as a continuous line.



## Conditions

Complex multi-layer cloud scene while we profiled through the freezing layer. Measured drizzle, rain and snow above and below the melting layer. At times it was hard to stay in cloud and to assess which flight level the cloud layer was at, but continued porpoising with a lot of in-cloud time. Afterwards we sampled cirrus North of Andenes.
