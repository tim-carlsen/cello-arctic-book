:class: tip

```{admonition} Flight summary
:class: note
<p style='text-align: justify;'>During the research flight on 3rd October 2025, we targeted <b>mixed-phase clouds</b>, and specifically the <b>melting layer</b> between <b>0.9 and 4.0 km altitude</b> underneath <b>EarthCARE (orbit #7665C)</b>. We performed porpoising through the melting layer, covering temperatures between <b>-5°C and +6°C</b> and sampling liquid droplets, ice crystals, drizzle, rain and snow. It was a very complex multi-layer scene, so it was hard to say when we were in cloud and when it was just high humidity soup around us. Thus, we also performed some cloud layer hunting, flying some short straight legs when we caught a cloud layer. </p>

Flight path (dashed line) superimposed on the MSI-RGR-1C product on 3rd October 2025. The ATLID ground track is shown in yellow, while the EC leg (for correlative observations) is shown as a continuous line.


## Conditions

During the EC leg we measured in mixed-phase cloud conditions, sampling liquid droplets, ice crystals, snow and rain. However, it was a very complex multi-layer situation, and we performed porpoising and cloud deck hunting. We porpoised through the melting layer again, sampling in temperatures between -5°C and 6°C.
