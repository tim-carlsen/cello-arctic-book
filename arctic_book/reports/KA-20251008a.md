:class: tip
<b>Cb Anvil Cirrus:</b> Straight legs through cirrus outflow in Arctic deep convection.<br>
```


```{admonition} Flight summary
:class: note
<p style='text-align: justify;'>During the research flight on 8th October 2025, we targeted <b>Cb Anvil Cirrus</b> between <b>7.0 and 7.6 km altitude</b> underneath <b>EarthCARE (orbit #7743C)</b>. The convection was stronger than expected, so we did not sample in the mid-level mixed-phase regime as originally planned, but instead within the cirrus outflow covering temperatures between -35°C and -38°C. We flew straight legs at different altitudes underneath EarthCARE and overall sampled 10 million ice crystals.</p>

Flight path (dashed line) superimposed on the MSI-RGR-1C product on 8th October 2025. The ATLID ground track is shown in yellow, while the EC leg (for correlative observations) is shown as a continuous line.



## Conditions

During the EC leg we measured high altitude cirrus clouds in the cumulonimbus anvil outflow region over the ocean right west of Lofoten Islands.

- 14:04 UTC: going up
- 14:18 UTC: go up to FL240, WP1, turn
- 14:21 UTC: going back on lack
- 14:24 UTC: WP1, turn on track again
- 14:28 UTC: WP2, will stay at this FL for way back to WP1
- 14:35 UTC: on leg but North of WP2 still
- 14:37 UTC: WP2
- 14:43 UTC: WP1, turn home
- Landing KRN: 15:30 UTC (17:30 LT)
