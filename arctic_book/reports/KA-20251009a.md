```{admonition} Flight summary
:class: note
<p style='text-align: justify;'>During the research flight on 9th October 2025, we targeted <b>cirrus clouds</b> between <b>6.7 and 7.9 km altitude</b> underneath <b>EarthCARE (orbit #7758C)</b>. We sampled in cirrus clouds at temperatures between -24°C and -32°C. Multiple layers of thin cirrus made it challenging to stay in cloud, and we had numerous altitude changes to sample ice crystals. Directly after the correlative observations under EC, we performed two spirals and sampled similar clouds over the <b>ground-based ACTRIS site at Pallas.</b></p>

Flight track for KA-20251009a.
```
Flight path (dashed line) superimposed on the MSI-RGR-1C product on 9th October 2025. The ATLID ground track is shown in yellow, while the EC leg (for correlative observations) is shown as a continuous line.



## Conditions

The conditions during the EC overpass were quite challenging, as we sampled in multiple layers of thin cirrus clouds, so constant altitude changes were necessary to stay in-cloud. Similar conditions also prevailed over the Pallas site, but we still sampled ice crystals in several cirrus layers.
