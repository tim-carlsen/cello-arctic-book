- 13:50 UTC: TAS242, -32°C, FL230
- 13:52 UTC: glory, liquid in cloud, 2DS-H sees crystals, TAS233
- 13:53 UTC: TAS240, -28°C, FL208, FCDP sees something (liquid - glory)
- 13:56 UTC: seeing crystals, TAS234, FL209
- 13:59 UTC: TAS260, -26°C, FL207
- 14:00 UTC: TAS250, few crystals, little liquid
- 14:01 UTC: lots of crystals, big crystals (only 2DS-H)+FCDP
- 14:03 UTC: TAS251, -27°C, FL202, FCDP goes wild, right at cloud top, large crystals on 2DS-V and 2DS-H also a lot
- 14:04 UTC: a lot in FCDP, TAS256
- 14:06 UTC: -28°C
- 14:06 UTC: TAS245, nothing on probes
- 14:07 UTC: FL200
- 14:08 UTC: TAS216, -27°C
- 14:09 UTC: FL190, clear sky below
- 14:11 UTC: TAS212, -25°C, FL200
- 14:12 UTC: some crystals again, Bullet rosettes (B-Rs)
- 14:13 UTC: TAS213, -28°C, FL216
- 14:14 UTC: TAS221, ascending a bit more
- 14:15 UTC: TAS221, -28°C, FL220
- 14:16 UTC: TAS222, -30°C, FL225, a few crystals
- 14:19 UTC: TAS214, -30°C, FL230, some B-Rs
- 14:21 UTC: TAS218, -32°C, FL235, maybe crystals too big, turning home
- 14:23 UTC: lots of crystals now, maybe still at match for this data due to crosswind, and still in MSI swath
- 14:25 UTC: 2DS-H sees quite some crystals
- 14:26 UTC: also 2DS-V now, TAS220, FL250
- 14:27 UTC: lots of crystals, TAS222, -36°C, FL250
- 14:30 UTC: TAS230, FL250
- 14:36 UTC: TAS235, -36°C, FL250
- 14:40 UTC: lots of crystals, still in MSI swath?, start descending
