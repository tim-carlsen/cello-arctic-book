<b>Altostratus mixed-phase clouds:</b> Porpoising through entire mixed-phase cloud deck.<br>
```


```{admonition} Flight summary
:class: note
<p style='text-align: justify;'>During the research flight on 14th October 2025, we targeted <b>altostratus mixed-phase clouds</b> between <b>6.1 and 7.0 km altitude</b> underneath <b>EarthCARE (orbit #7836C/D)</b>. We sampled in the mixed-phase regime at temperatures between -22°C and -25°C. We porpoised through the cloud reaching above cloud top and below cloud base, sampling many small, liquid droplets and ice crystals. We spiraled before the start of the EC leg and continued porpoising until returning to WP1, resulting in a long time window of potential correlative observations.</p>

Flight track for KA-20251014a.
```
Flight path (dashed line) superimposed on the MSI-RGR-1C product on 14th October 2025. The ATLID ground track is shown in yellow, while the EC leg (for correlative observations) is shown as a continuous line.

## Conditions

The altostratus clouds moved into the EC track right on time for the overpass, and we managed to first sample a vertical profile before starting the leg, followed by about an hour of porpoising through the altostratus deck. The closest correlative observations were performed on the southbound leg, whilst the impressions from the instruments indicate quite stable conditions when sampling the same cloud deck on the northbound leg later on.
